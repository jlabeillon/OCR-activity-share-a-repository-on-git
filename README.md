# OCR-activity-share-a-repository-on-git
Here is my project to complete the activity called : Share a repository on GIT.

(My file is note "README.txt" as you wish, but a ".md" file, is it a problem for you ?)

So, my idea is to initialize a simple Symfony's Project, and just add some Controllers.

First, to create a Symfony's application i need to use these commande :

``composer create-project symfony/skeleton my-project``

``composer require server --dev``

``php bin/console server:run``

and optionnal :

``composer require sec-checker``

If you clone this repository, don't forget to use :

``composer install``
